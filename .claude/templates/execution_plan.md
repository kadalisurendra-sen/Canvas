# Execution Plan: [Task Title]

**Feature Spec**: `specs/features/[feature-name].md`
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [draft | approved | in-progress | completed | abandoned]
**Approved by**: [human name or "pending"]

> **This plan requires human approval before implementation begins.**
> No code is written until status changes from "draft" to "approved".

## Purpose

What someone can do after this change that they could not do before.

## Context and Orientation
